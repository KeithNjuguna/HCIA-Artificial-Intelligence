1.Intelligence and Multiple Intelligences
Howard Gardner proposed the theory of multiple intelligences, which includes:

Linguistic-verbal intelligence

Logical-mathematical intelligence

Visual-spatial intelligence

Bodily-kinesthetic intelligence

Musical-rhythmic and harmonic intelligence

Interpersonal intelligence

Intrapersonal intelligence

Naturalistic intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI)
AI studies and develops theories, techniques, and applications that simulate and extend human intelligence.

Term coined by John McCarthy in 1956 as "the science and engineering of making intelligent machines."

AI enables machines to learn from data and make human-like decisions.

Machine Learning (ML)
A subfield of AI that allows computers to learn from experience (data) and improve performance.

Tom Mitchell defined ML as a process where a computer program learns from experience to perform tasks better.

ML intersects with data mining (DM) and knowledge discovery in databases (KDD).

Deep Learning (DL)
A subset of ML that originates from artificial neural networks.

Uses hierarchical representations to analyze and interpret data (e.g., images, voice, text).

Based on multilayer perceptron (MLP) structures.

Relationship Between AI, ML, and DL
AI: Broad discipline that simulates human intelligence.

ML: Subset of AI focusing on learning from data to make predictions.

DL: Subset of ML using deep neural networks for complex data analysis.

Symbolic AI (Symbolicism)
Also called logicism or psychologism, derived from mathematical logic.

Views human cognition as a reasoning process based on symbols.

Proposed by McCarthy in 1956, leading to expert systems and knowledge engineering.

Remained a dominant AI approach even after the rise of other theories.

Major Schools of AI
Connectionism
Also known as bionicsism or physiologism, focuses on AI originating from the study of the human brain.

Emphasizes neurons as the basic thinking unit rather than symbols.

The McCulloch-Pitts (MP) neuron model was proposed in 1943.

The artificial neural network (ANN) is a key technique but presents interpretability challenges.

In 1986, David Rumelhart introduced the backpropagation (BP) algorithm, revitalizing connectionism research.

Actionism
Also called evolutionism or cyberneticsism, argues AI originates from cybernetics.

Intelligence depends on perception and actions rather than knowledge or reasoning.

Led to the development of intelligent control and robotics in the 1980s.

Rodney Brooks' six-legged robot exemplifies actionism, using a "perception-action" model.

AI Development History
The Dartmouth Conference (1956) marked the birth of AI.

Scientists like John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Claude Shannon, and Herbert Simon contributed.

The Lisp programming language played a significant role in early AI development.

Types of AI
Strong AI
Aims to replicate human intelligence, reasoning, self-awareness, and problem-solving.

Capable of independent thought, self-learning, and adaptation.

Hypothetically, simulating the human brain at full scale could lead to strong AI.

Weak AI
Designed for specific tasks and relies on human input.

Includes applications like AlphaGo and AI-generated content.

Relies on data and computing power to perform specialized tasks.

AI Industry Ecosystem
AI applications require data, algorithms, computing power, and application scenarios.

AI integrates with cloud computing, big data, and IoT to advance intelligent systems.
