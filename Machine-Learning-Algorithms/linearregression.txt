**Linear Regression**
Linear Regression is used to predict a continuous value, like house prices or temperatures. It finds a straight line that best fits the data points. Think of it as drawing the line that most accurately represents the trend in your data.

Polynomial Regression
Sometimes, the relationship between data points isn't a straight lineâ€”it might curve or twist. Polynomial Regression helps capture those patterns by fitting a more flexible curve (instead of a straight line) to the data. It still works similarly to Linear Regression but adds more complexity to better match the data.

Preventing Overfitting
Overfitting happens when a model learns the training data too well and starts memorizing the noise rather than understanding the actual patterns. This makes it perform poorly on new data. To prevent overfitting:

Simplify the model: Avoid using overly complex formulas or too many features unless necessary.

Regularization: Add constraints to the model to discourage overly complicated solutions.

Validation: Test the model on different datasets to ensure it performs well on unseen data.

In short, Linear Regression is a simple way to predict values, Polynomial Regression extends it for more complex patterns, and preventing overfitting ensures the model can handle new, unseen data effectively
